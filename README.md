# Famicase-grabber
Famicase grabber : A windows batch to download all covers from the Famicase contest (2017)

Context :
---------
Each year the famicase contest allows contestants to create original cartdrige
covers for non existing games using famicom cart format. Following this first contest a 	 
second one takes place :  A Game By Its Cover. For this second one I needed the arts.		 

Why this script ? 
-----------------
The famicase website is a bit slow and it's not easy to peruse all the covers at once.	 
So I initially created this poorly written script to grab all covers from the website into 
a local folder. Then I decided to get the html files too as some artists had an idea about	 
what type of game the art should illustrate and describe it in the html file. 			 
Unfortunately the description text wasn't displayed because of the lack of css. 			 
As I am lazy I just altered the batch to grab the index file and everything it needs to    
display proper data.							 											 
Hilariously doing so mixed up the so wanted covers with thumbs, artist pp and such :sic:	 
So I ended up creating a new folder Famicases which only contains the covers. Pfiou !	

Oh and one more thing : this is slow has hell. It takes about 7 to 8 minutes to grab 'em all, go fetch some tasty coffee lads ;)
